//when using a method from another class, make the method an object. Class name, assign object a name, set the object to new class.
//clarify which method you want to use in the class. Can be multiple classes with multiple methods.
//() is used whenever you call a METHOD, even if the arguments are empty, hence () has nothing inside.
